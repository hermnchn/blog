set up a cloud virtual machine to install Linux -> good way to experience it
https://cloud.google.com/compute
https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/launch-a-virtual-machine/

consider Oracle's VirtualBox (a VM you can run locally on your machine)

intall docker desktop for windows/mac
then run linux containers (Ubunta, CentOS, etc.)
process is super simple, footprint of containers are much smaller than running a hypervisor w/ VM (VMware fusion/virtualbox/workstation)
besides that, get exposure to containerization along w/ orchestration (kubernetes, etc) which are the future of using/consuming apps in the future
