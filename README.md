- 👋 Hi, I’m @hermnchn
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a fullstack developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web app to mobile app transition.
- 📫 How to reach me either on Linkedin or Twitter.

Status: Currently, I'm looking into apprenticeship programs and using their qualification guidelines as a metric on what skills I need to double-down on. It's surprisingly efficient way of knowing what level of knowledge I should have or acquire before applying for jobs. 

Project: Re-evaluating past projects and making a stronger portfolio is the goal now.

Happy to say I brought the "Python by No Starch Press" Humble Bundle before it ended today. 

Oh... O'Reily has a interesting book bundle on their 'Cookbook' series. Little more than 8 days left before it ends.
