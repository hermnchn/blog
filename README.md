- 📫 How to reach me either on Linkedin or Twitter.

Status: Currently, I'm looking into apprenticeship programs and using their qualification guidelines as a metric on what skills I need to double-down on. It's surprisingly efficient way of knowing what level of knowledge I should have or acquire before applying for jobs. Learning about the "Big O". Been too busy to even sit down and code properly. Reworking my resume. Found a good resource on what to put in. That was annoying as heck. Doing some housekeeping. Decided to not over stress in using GitHub everyday. Mental health is important. Changing bandages.

Project: Re-evaluating past projects and making a stronger portfolio is the goal now. Wondering if doing the same project is another language is worth showcasing.

Happy to say I brought the "Python by No Starch Press" Humble Bundle. Consolidating some Reddit advice on which books to prioritize.
Brought two courses to supplement what I'm learning atm from the Udemy sale. Hopefully Go isn't too difficult to understand.

Thanks to my friend providing a copy of a great resource in writing tech resumes. Already half way through the book. Done reading the book today. Time to implement what I learned. Looking into how to write good README files for any project.
