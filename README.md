- 👋 Hi, I’m @hermnchn
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a fullstack developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web app to mobile app transition.
- 📫 How to reach me either on Linkedin or Twitter.

Status: Currently, I'm looking into apprenticeship programs and using their qualification guidelines as a metric on what skills I need to double-down on. It's surprisingly efficient way of knowing what level of knowledge I should have or acquire before applying for jobs. Wow so nice to have something working again. So cool how it turned out. Sometimes I wonder why everything has to be in hard mode. Been awhile since I had a minor axiety attack. 

Project: Re-evaluating past projects and making a stronger portfolio is the goal now. Looking at other peoples' examples for the good and bad.

Happy to say I brought the "Python by No Starch Press" Humble Bundle. Consolidating some Reddit advice on which books to prioritize.
Brought two courses to supplement what I'm learning atm from the Udemy sale. Hopefully Go isn't too difficult to understand.
