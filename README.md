- 👋 Hi, I’m @hermnchn
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a fullstack developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web app to mobile app transition.
- 📫 How to reach me either on Linkedin or Twitter.

Status: Currently, everything is fixed and working properly between VScode, Github Desktop, and Github. Be careful when setting up repo especially on how to connect them to local drive. Finally, could look into other ways to upload to Github; maybe sublime text is possible option. Maybe it's time to take a break from coding and do coding related stuff. Forget to mention that I slowly revising my resume atm.

Project: It's time for the big one. I plan to redo my big project using AI api. Hope it goes according to plan. Took a break to try a smaller project on the side.
