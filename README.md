- 👋 Hi, I’m @hermnchn
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a fullstack developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web app to mobile app transition.
- 📫 How to reach me either on Linkedin or Twitter.


Status: Finish moving and close to being done unpacking my stuff. Reorganizing everything atm. Might check out a few bootcamps for fun. Meetup turn out pretty decent. Guess it's time to start again. So much going on; a bit hard to keep up. Hmmm. It's end of the year. Attending the last meetups of this year. Woot x3. Xmas break maybe?


Project(s): Re-evaluating everything I done so far.
