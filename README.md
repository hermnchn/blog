- 👋 Hi, I’m @hermnchn
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a fullstack developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web app to mobile app transition.
- 📫 How to reach me either on Linkedin or Twitter.

Status: Currently, learning data structures and algorithms; also learning about the "Big O". Reworking my resume. Found a good resource on what to put in. Decided to not over stress in using GitHub everyday. Mental health is important. Today I ate a pizza bowl from wholesale retailer, I didn't think it was possible for it to be even more worse than their sushi. Mistakes where made. 

Project: Re-evaluating past projects and making a stronger portfolio is the goal now. Wondering if doing the same project is another language is worth showcasing. Working on smaller projects not for portfolio but rather gain skills usefull for bigger projects.
