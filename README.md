- 👋 Hi, I’m @hermnchn
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a fullstack developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web app to mobile app transition.
- 📫 How to reach me either on Linkedin or Twitter.

Status: Currently, seems like I learning new thing or at least gaining a better understanding working thru the AI api project. Might go back to the other react project I did and see if I gain some more insights. Meanwhile, I realize working on smaller to medium size projects keep my motivation going strong. Doing my best not to mentally stress myself out for not coding long enough. Health first and foremost before coding. Researching and sorting out a bunch of coding resources. Thinking about replacing my broken laptop w/ a new one. Narrow down a few options. Holy moly I'm out for the count. It's going be a rough few days of recovery. Finally starting feeling better; post surgery checkup coming up. Hope everything looks good.

Project: Finish up 20 project course before heading back to main project. Take what I learn and apply it.

News: No Starch Press has another great Humble Bundle offering 18 books on Python. Less than 20 days left before it ends.
