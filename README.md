Status: Currently, trying to resolve unknown issue between VSCode, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop. Seems like GitHub Desktop was setup correctly; doubt problem lies with GitHub so it's either VSCode or Git. Double-checking documentation for VSCode; might have missed something. Git is good tho. Possible fixed didn't work since no files where uploaded here from local drive. Might be the extra stuff I installed before using VSCode. Need to run some tests.
