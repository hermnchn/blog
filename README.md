- 👋 Hi, I’m @hermnchn
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a fullstack developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web app to mobile app transition.
- 📫 How to reach me either on Linkedin or Twitter.

Status: Currently, seems like I learning new thing or at least gaining a better understanding working thru the AI api project. Might go back to the other react project I did and see if I gain some more insights. Meanwhile, I realize working on smaller to medium size projects keep my motivation going strong. Past few days felt much better. Manage to do some coding. Spending more time reading documentation.

Project: AI api is taking more time to organize and setup again.
